WARNING: [DRC PDRC-153] Gated clock check: Net design_1_i/adc_0/inst/clock is a gated clock net sourced by a combinational pin design_1_i/adc_0/inst/data_ready_i_3/O, cell design_1_i/adc_0/inst/data_ready_i_3. This is not good design practice and will likely impact performance. For SLICE registers, for example, use the CE pin to control the loading of data.
WARNING: [DRC PLHOLDVIO-2] Non-Optimal connections which could lead to hold violations: A LUT design_1_i/adc_0/inst/data_ready_i_3 is driving clock pin of 19 cells. This could lead to large hold time violations. Involved cells are:
